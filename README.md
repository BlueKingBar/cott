The D2Ware classic is back with a new twist! Players get souls over time and from player kills, which increase your stats and model size! However, holding on to your souls reduces the healing you receive. Collect totems to grant yourself a passive soul gain buff, or to keep that buff on a teammate who previously collected it. Push creeps to grow your team even further! Deposit your souls into the pot at the center of the map to score your team points and heal up. First team to 400 points wins!

Details:

- Each soul provides .75 of each attribute (Strength, Agility, Intelligence).

- On death, you lose half of your souls to your killer.

- Souls top out at 90.

- The totem buff increases your soul gain by 1. In addition, this bonus increases it by 1 more every 30 seconds. This resets and is lost if an opponent takes a totem, but persists on the same person if a teammate grabs it. The owner of the buff cannot grab further totems until the buff is lost.

- Totems spawn every 30 seconds in a similar fashion to runes (i.e. if one exists, another will not spawn, and which spot they spawn at is random).

- Killing someone with more souls than you heals you by 4% per soul difference. This is not reduced by having many souls.

- Depositing souls not only gives your team 1 point per soul, but heals you for 4% per soul. Soul depositing is instantaneous and immediately brings you to zero souls if you have a positive number of souls.

- Each creep pushed into the enemy's portal grants your whole team 1 soul.

- All heroes gain 1.2 non-multiplied mana regen and start with 3.0 base HP regen.

Pudge Changes:

- Pudge's passive now grants flat strength instead of strength per kill.

Legion Commander Changes:

- LC's ultimate is now a 2/3/4-second BKB-piercing stun. In addition, she gains damage equal to half a duel win for 3 seconds every time she attacks, including MoC procs.

Disabled Heroes:

- Wraith King: Ultimate interaction with mode bugged.

- Meepo: Really, really buggy in general.

- Silencer: Int steal cannot be disabled.

- Techies: Not in Source 2, impossible to add at the moment.

I will attempt to add in the disabled heroes at a later date if I can solve the problems they have. My apologies if you wanted to play as them, but I don't want the mode to be glitched or unfun.
