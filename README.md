Dota 2 Clash of the Titans
--------------------------

In this Dota 2 mod, you slowly gain souls over time or from collecting totems that spawn in the rivers on the map. Souls give damage and attributes. You can deposit souls in the center of the map to score your team points. Holding on to too many souls makes you lose your HP if you don't have a totem to protect you though, so be careful! First team to 400 points wins.
